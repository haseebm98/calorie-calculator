# Calorie Calculator

Overview:
The Calorie Intake Calculator is a web-based application designed to help users determine their daily calorie needs based on several personal attributes and activity levels. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with Graph.js) to create a user-friendly interface where users can input their age, gender, height, weight, duration of workouts, and workout intensity. The calculator then processes this information to provide a customized daily calorie intake recommendation. Using Graph.js, the information is aesthetically presented in a bar chart that enables users to understand their caloric needs in an easier way.
